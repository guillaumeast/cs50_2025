## 🧠 What is this about?
This project involves creating a C program that encrypts messages using a substitution cipher. The program takes a 26-character key as a command-line argument, prompts the user for plaintext input, and outputs the corresponding ciphertext by substituting each letter according to the provided key. The program ensures that non-alphabetical characters remain unchanged and preserves the case of the original letters.
