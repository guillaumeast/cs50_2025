THIS IS CS50
Harvard cs50 2025 problem sets
Made by Guillaume Astesana
(Absolutely no code has been generated from any IA, exepcted the readme files)

Folders are organised by weeks
Each week contains one or more problem set, ordered by growing difficulty.
Problem sets folders in each week folder starts by the correspondig week index followed by problem set index, both starting from 0 ðŸ¤“
=> e.g : "3.2 - Problem_name" is the third problem set of week 3 (fourth week)
=> week.0 is the simplest one, week.1 is harder than week.0, and so on...

Each problem set contains a readme with link to ressources from Harvard website :
- Lecture (Youtube, two hours or so)
- Sections (Youtube, one hour or so)
- Shorts (Youtube, few minutes long)
- Problem sets statements...)
