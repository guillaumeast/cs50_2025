## 🧠 What is this about?
This project involves creating a C program that implements a ranked-choice voting system using Tideman's method. Voters rank candidates by preference, and the program processes these rankings to determine the winner by recording pairs of candidates, sorting them by the strength of victory, and locking them in without creating cycles. The goal is to ensure that the candidate who would win any head-to-head matchup is elected.
