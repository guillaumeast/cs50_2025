# 🗃️ Week 3.0 - Sort

## 🔗 Resources
- **Problem Statement:** [Sort Problem Set](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2025/psets/3/sort/)

## 🧠 What is this about?
In this project, you'll analyze three pre-compiled sorting programs—`sort1`, `sort2`, and `sort3`—to identify which sorting algorithm each implements: selection sort, bubble sort, or merge sort. By running these programs on various datasets and observing their performance, you'll determine the algorithm used in each program and document your findings in an `answers.txt` file.
