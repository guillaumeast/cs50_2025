sort1 uses: Bubble sort

How do you know?: It's the fastest algorithm for sorted50000.txt => lowest Ω() (sort2 excluded because I already know it's merge sort)

sort2 uses: Merge sort

How do you know?: It's the fastest algorithm for random50000.txt => lowest O()

sort3 uses: Selection sort

How do you know?: It's the slowest algorithm for both random50000.txt and sorted50000.txt => highest both O() and Ω()
