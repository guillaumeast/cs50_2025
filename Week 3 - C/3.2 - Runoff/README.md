## 🧠 What is this about?
This project involves creating a C program that simulates an instant runoff election using a ranked-choice voting system. Voters rank candidates by preference, and the program processes these rankings to determine the winner. If no candidate secures more than half of the first-choice votes, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated, and votes are redistributed based on the next preferences. This process repeats until a candidate achieves a majority.
