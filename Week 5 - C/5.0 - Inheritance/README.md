# 🧬 Week 5.0 - Inheritance

## 🔗 Resources
- **Problem Statement:** [Inheritance Problem Set](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2025/psets/5/inheritance/)

## 🧠 What is this about?
This project involves simulating the inheritance of blood types across multiple generations using a C program. Each person is represented by a struct containing pointers to their parents and an array of two alleles. The program recursively creates a family tree, assigns random alleles to the oldest generation, and determines alleles for descendants based on their parents' alleles. It also includes functionality to print the family tree and free allocated memory.&#8203;:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
